# Hibernate test
This program tests hibernate functionality autonomously, user only needs to specify the type of test

## Configuration
The program loads SQL scritps automatically, they can be found in resources.

To configure the program please use [`db.properties`](src/main/resources/db.properties) file

P.S. The code is awful, but such is life
